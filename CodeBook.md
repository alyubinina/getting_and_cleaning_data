## Codebook: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

#### Sourse Data Set

This project uses data from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The data represents measurements  captured from smartphones Samsung Galaxy S II on the waist of 30 subjects who were performing six activities of daily living. Information about sourse data set file is in *README.txt* file in **UCI HAR Dataset** directory. 
The project used the following files from the data set:

+ *features.txt* - list of all features
+ *activity_labels.txt* - links the class labels with their activity name
+ from train directory:
  - *X_train.txt* - training set
  - *y_train.txt* - training labels
  - *subject_train.txt* - each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample in the train data set
+ from test directory:
  - *X_test.txt* - test set
  - *y_test.txt* - test labels
  - *subject_test.txt* - each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample in the test data set
